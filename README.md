# CS100 RShell
> Spring 2019 - Daniel Kwong (862032167) and Jason Chang (862046747)

## Introduction
Our program will be a basic command shell that will be created using C++. The shell will be able to take in and execute standard commands. It will also have 3 connectors: "||", "&&", and ";". They will allow the user to run multiple commands at once. The composite pattern will be used to handle all commands and operators. We will have a base class that connects characters and images.
